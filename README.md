Landing-page
This is a bit spooky initially, just because there are a lot of design elements. Bet you the next project won't have any design ideas. 
I also have yet to decide what pictures and actual information will be on the website, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

Finished the project and using flexbox makes everything so much easier
Biggest challenge that was easily resolved was inability to wrap the main section with cards, however this was quickly rectified once I realised I had put flex: wrap instead of flex-wrap: wrap, silly mistake but it took some time to figure out
Doing the pages systematically from top to bottom was definitely the way forward
Also took me less time than the previous recipes project which is fun
