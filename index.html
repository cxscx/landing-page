                <div class='card'><img src="images/cute-dog-1.jpeg" alt="cute dog jumping"><p>Look at this good boii. Just jumping around and that, with pure unadulterated joy. Wish we could all be like that. If humanity could just be happy and frolick, I believe we'd probably have solved world hunger by now, as well as have already colonised Mars.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><img src="./images/cute-dog-2.jpeg" alt="small-ish dog holding tennis ball"><p>LOOK AT HER. The ball is basically the size of her mouth and she's managed to fit it in. What a good girl. If only humanity tackled its biggest problems with the same resilience and determination that this good girl does.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><img src="./images/cute-dog-3.webp" alt="cute small dog sitting up straight"><p>How is something so tiny and cute even real. You know when you see human babies and they illicit that "awwww" response; this is the exact same thing except they aren't parasites that grow inside humans for 9 months at a time.</p></div>
                <div class="card"><img src="./images/cute-dog-4.jpeg" alt="3 dogs trying to hold a stick"><p>These 3 good doggos are all playing and holding that stick, the big guy on the end is hogging it all and the poor guy on the end gets no stick. Giving sibling rivalry and playfulness, it's so cute to see. Inspirational. They're getting on better than some of y'all do with your siblings.</p></div>
